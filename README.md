# Loan Default Prediction using Machine Learning

# Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default on a loan using machine learning techniques. 
By analyzing applicant financialand personalinformation, the model helps financial institutions make smarter and safer lending decisions.
The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an optional web application for easy and interactive predictions.

# Objectives
1. Predict loan default risk accurately
2. Assist banks and financial institutions in decision-making
3. Automate loan risk assessment using ML
4. Provide clear and understandable prediction output

# Machine Learning Approach
1. Learning Type: Supervised Learning
2. Problem Type: Binary Classification
3. Models Used:
   Logistic Regression
   Random Forest Classifier

#  Dataset
1. Source: Kaggle (Loan Dataset)
2. Features Include:
   Applicant Income
   Loan Amount
   Credit History
   Employment Status
   Loan Status

# Project Workflow
1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Prediction Generation


# Web Application
A user-friendly Streamlit web application is implemented to allow users to input applicant details and get instant predictions.

**Prediction Output:**

0 → Loan is NOT likely to default

1 → Loan is likely to default

Both numeric and text outputs are shown for better clarity.
